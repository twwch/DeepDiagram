## What is DeepDiagram?

DeepDiagram is an open-source AI visualization platform that transforms natural language descriptions into professional diagrams. Whether you need mind maps, flowcharts, data charts, or system architecture diagrams, simply describe your requirements in a sentence and AI will automatically generate them.

## Six Specialized AI Agents

DeepDiagram includes six specialized AI agents, each focusing on a specific visualization domain:

1. **Mind Map Agent** - Automatically analyzes topic structure and generates multi-level mind maps
2. **Flowchart Agent** - Transforms business processes into clear flowcharts
3. **Data Chart Agent** - Supports bar, line, pie, and 20+ chart types
4. **Architecture Agent** - Generates professional system architecture and network topology diagrams
5. **Mermaid Agent** - Supports sequence, Gantt, class diagrams, and more
6. **Infographic Agent** - Transforms data into beautiful infographics

## Technical Architecture

DeepDiagram is built on LangGraph multi-agent architecture:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- **AI Orchestration**: LangGraph + LangChain
- **Deployment**: One-click Docker deployment
